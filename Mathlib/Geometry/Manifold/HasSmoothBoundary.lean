# Smooth manifolds with smooth boundary

Many manifolds coming up in differential geometry or applications have "nice" boundary,
i.e. the boundary is again a (smooth) manifold one dimension lower.
The definition `IsManifold` does not enforce this, in order to also include manifolds
with corners. In this file, we define a typeclass `HasNiceBoundary`, for smooth manifolds whose
boundary is again a smooth manifold such that the inclusion $∂M → M` is smooth.
We do *not* require that `M` or `∂M` be finite-dimensional
(nor that, in the finite case, `∂M` have co-dimension one).

## Main definitions and results

* `BoundaryManifoldData I E₀ H₀ I₀` encodes a smooth manifold `M` modelled on `I` having smooth
  boundary: this is encoded by a pair (M₀, f) of a `C^n` manifold `M₀` modelled on `I₀`
  over the pair `(E₀, H₀)` and a smooth embedding `f: M₀ → M` whose image is precisely `∂M`.

* `BoundaryManifoldData.of_boundaryless`: a boundaryless manifold has smooth boundary
  (namely, any empty type)
* `BoundaryManifoldData.Icc`: a real interval `[x, y]` (for `x < y`) has smooth boundary
* `BoundaryManifoldData.prod_of_boundaryless_left`: if `M` is boundaryless and `N` has smooth
  boundary, so does `M × N`
* `BoundaryManifoldData.prod_of_boundaryless_right`: if `M` has smooth boundary and `N` is
  boundaryless, `M × N` has smooth boundary
* `BoundaryManifoldData.sum`: if `M` and `N` are modelled on the same model `I` and have smooth
  boundary, so does their disjoint union `M ⊕ N`

## TODO
* `BoundaryManifoldData.euclideanHalfSpace_self`: n-dimensional Euclidean half-space has smooth
  boundary (e.g., `n-1`-dimensional Euclidean space)
* if `M` is `n`-dimensional and modelled on Euclidean half-space
  (such that the model is surjective),
  it has smooth boundary: this might require e.g. invariance of domain

/-- Let `M` be a `C^k` real manifold, modelled on the pair `(E, H)`. We say that `M` has nice
boundary if exist a smooth manifold `N` and a smooth embedding `φ : N ↪ M` with image `∂M`.

`BoundaryManifoldData` is a data-carrying structure which captures this: it consists of a smooth
manifold `N` and a smooth embedding `f : M₀ → M` such that `range f = I.boundary M`.

A priori, we could allow the model spaces `E` and `H` for `N`, as well as the model with corners
on it, to vary freely: for applications in bordism theory, this proves impractical.
To formalise the statement "The manifold `W` has smooth boundary `M \sqcup N`", we could like
to consider the disjoint union of two BoundaryManifoldData: this works best if we fix the model
spaces and model with corners as part of their type.
For this reason, the `ModelWithCorners` (and the underlying pair `(E, H)`)
are part of this structure's parameters.

The first version of this said "I.boundary M is a smooth manifold".
This proved hard to work with, as I.boundary M is a subset, and computing the boundary means
we'd like to rewrite by an equivalence of sets. This runs into DTT, equality of types is bad.

Second version: we prescribe a smooth manifold M₀, and ask for a smooth embedding of M₀ into M,
whose image is the boundary of M. This will allow rewriting the boundary.
A smooth embedding is characterised by having injective differential (being an immersion)
and being a topological embedding.
(Perhaps it's not good enough either, we'll see. Let's try!)

Is a pair `(M₀, f)` of a smooth manifold `M₀` modelled over `(E₀, H₀)` and an embedding
`f : M₀ → M` which is a smooth immersion, such that `range f = I.boundary M`.
